= Data folder

This folder is place where you have to put the project's data.
It is composoed of two folders :

* `csv` that must contains the csv that will be used in the initial import
* `images` that should contains all the images of the imported data

The *CSV* folder is only used by the API service during the initialization process,
while the *images* one is used by the web server (nginx) to serve the files.
