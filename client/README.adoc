== Description

It's a react application created with the helps of _react-scripts_ with typescript support.

== Usage

=== Installation

Just run those commands :

[source,bash]
----
$> npm install
$> npm start
----

=== Start

To run the project, you juste have to use `npm start`.
The application will be available on http://localhost:3000

=== Build

To build the project just run `npm build`.
The build will be located under the `build` directory.

=== Eject

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time by running the following command :

[source,bash]
----
npm run eject
----

IMPORTANT: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc)
right into your project so you have full control over them.
All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject.
The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments,
and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature.
However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
